<p> I have always been fascinated by symmetry. </p>
<p> I remember coming across images of massive identical blocks of buildings in Asia one next to another, </p>
<p> making it almost impossible to tell them apart. I thought it would be intriguing to attempt to recreate such a concept.</p>
<p> Random is so fun! </p>

<h2> Ocean Waves </h2>
<p><em> ~ Sinusoidal Sketch ~ </em></p>
