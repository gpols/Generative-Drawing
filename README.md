### The Running Blocks (Random Sketch)
I have always been fascinated by symmetry. 
I remember coming across images of massive identical blocks of buildings in Asia one next to another, 
making it almost impossible to tell them apart. I thought it would be intriguing to attempt to recreate such a concept.
Random is so fun!
