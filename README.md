<h2> Dancing flower </h2>
<p><em> ~ Phase Sketch ~ </em></p>

<p> My very first attempt at coding for art was a wild ride! So many options, so many cool ideas bouncing around. </p>
<p> After a bit of digging, I ended up diving into the fascinating world of mathematical roses. </p>
<li> Use of sine and cosine.  </li> 
<li> RGB colour mapped. </li>

<h2> The Running Blocks </h2>
<p><em> ~ Random Sketch ~ </em></p>

<p> Symmetry has always intrigued me. </p>
<p> I remember stumbling upon pictures of those huge, identical rows of buildings in Asia, where you couldn't even tell them apart.</p> 
<p> I thought it'd be cool to give it a shot, you know, just for fun! </p>
<li> Extensive use of random.</li>
<li> Applied colour theory.</li>

<h2> Ocean Waves </h2>
<p><em> ~ Sinusoidal Sketch ~ </em></p>

<p> Creating organic forms can be quite challenging in art. It's certainly a goal I'd like to achieve in one of my sketches. </p>
<p> I've decided to take on the challenge of recreating the dynamic and ever-changing shapes of ocean waves. </p>
<p> Unlike real waves, these will maintain a consistent and controlled shape. </p>
<li> Use of additive synthesis. </li>

<h2> ALTR Space </h2> 
<p><em> ~ Recursive Sketch ~ </em></p>

<img src="https://github.com/gpols/Generative-Drawing/blob/ccbbce6839d65c2d339fdff6b978ad61bc45fca3/images%3Agifs/recursive.png">
<p> For this sketch, I have let go of my pursuit of symmetry and discovered the beauty of depth. </p>
<p> In some distant galaxy, stars take on the form of various-sized rectangles, adrift in the immense expanse of space.</p>
<li> Recursive function.</li>
<li> WEBGL </li>

<h2> Mycelium </h2>  
<p><em> ~ Autonomous Agent Sketch ~ </em></p>

<p> This animation draws inspiration from the networks of fungal roots and was created using Boids code.</p>
